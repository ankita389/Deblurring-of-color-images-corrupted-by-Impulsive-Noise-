# Deblurring-of-color-images-corrupted-by-Impulsive-Noise-
Abstract: We consider the problem of restoring a multichannel image corrupted by blur and impulsive noise (e.g., salt-and-pepper noise). Using the variational framework, we consider the L1 fidelity term and several possible regularizers. In particular, we use generalizations of the Mumford-Shah (MS) functional to color images and Gamma-convergence approximations to unify deblurring and denoising. Experimental comparisons show that the MS stabilizer yields better results with respect to Beltrami and total variation regularizers. Color edge detection is a beneficial by-product of our methods.
